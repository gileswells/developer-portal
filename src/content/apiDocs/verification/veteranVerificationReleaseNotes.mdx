### Sep 22, 2021
The Veteran Verification API v1.0.0 was updated to include a change to the /disability_rating endpoint response. The DisabilityRatingAttributes will now show date (2018-03-27) rather than datetime (2018-03-27T21:00:41.000+0000). 

This was introduced as a versioned change to allow API consumers to upgrade at their convenience. We encourage all consumers to migrate to the new version as v0.0.0 will be removed on December 1, 2021.
