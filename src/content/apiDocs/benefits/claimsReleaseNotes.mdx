### February 15, 2022

- Updated the v1 validation endpoints to validate in the same way as their respective submission endpoints. These endpoints are:
  - POST "forms/526" and "forms/526/validate"
  - POST "forms/0966" and "forms/0966/validate"
  - POST "forms/2122" and "forms/2122/validate"

### February 10, 2022

- Updated test user representative Tamara Ellis' individual POA code to `067`. [#320](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/pull/320)
-- Using Tamara Ellis' previous code of `A1Q` will still work, but attempts to assign `A1Q` to a Veteran test user will not change their POA code.  Using `067` will change their POA code.
- Updated test user representative John Doe's individual POA code to `072`.  [#320](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/pull/320)
-- Using John Doe's previous code of `A1H` will still work, but attempts to assign `A1H` to a Veteran test user will not change their POA code.  Using `072` will change their POA code.

### January 25, 2022

We made updates to the v1 "/forms/526" endpoint to make sure the schemas and descriptions better match the wording on the 526EZ form:

- Several schema descriptions were updated, but their functionality remains unchanged. Updated schema descriptions can be reviewed in the [Benefits Claims API documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/claims?version=current).
- We deprecated 2 schemas because they were duplicating functionality supported by other schemas:
  1.  `servicePay.hasSeparationPay` was deprecated because its functionality is supported by `servicePay.separationPay`.
  2.  `servicePay.militaryRetiredPay.willReceiveInfuture` was deprecated because its functionality is supported by `servicePay.militaryRetiredPay.willReceiveInFuture`. It also fixes letter case inconsistencies.
