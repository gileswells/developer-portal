        <p>
          Breaking changes to published API versions can be disruptive to using APIs, so our policy
          is to ensure breaking changes aren’t published without a major version change. We will
          send you notifications before any new features or versions are added.
        </p>
        <p>
          We define a breaking change as any change that might adversely impact your use of an API.
          For example, removing an endpoint or field would be classified as a breaking change. A
          non-breaking change is one that does not adversely impact current users of an API, such as
          adding an endpoint or field. Non-breaking changes do not require a new version, but
          changes that could impact your experience or use of an API will have an accompanying
          release note.

          We occasionally deactivate features and versions of APIs based on updates and new
          technology. Before any functionality is deactivated, we will announce the change through
          release notes and note the deprecated functionality. We intend to make as few breaking
          changes as possible and to let you know as far in advance as possible.

        <p>
          Rate limiting is enforced at 60 requests per minute per consumer. Requests to APIs that
          don’t require authentication, like health checks, are rate limited per IP address.

        <h3 id="rate-limit-headers">Understanding rate limit response headers</h3>
        <p>
          Real-time rate limit information is returned in the response headers for each request.
          Each response will contain at least 5 response headers.

          More than one rate limit can apply to some requests. In these cases, additional headers
          are returned to take those rate limits into account. For example, a request with an
          additional rate limit for seconds would return the five headers listed above as well as
          the following two:
        </p>
        <ul>

        <h3 id="increasing-rate-limit">Increasing your rate limit</h3>
        <p>
          If you exceed the rate limiting quota, your request will return a 429 status code. You may
          petition for increased rate limits by emailing us at{' '}

          Rate limit increases are decided on a case-by-case basis and we do not alter the rate

            In the production environment, the API Gateway has a service level objective of 99.9%.

            This means the gateway can be unavailable for up to no more than about 3 hours a month

          We periodically perform auditing to remove inactive API keys and OAuth credentials, and to

        </p>
        <ul>

          We have full authorization to operate (ATO) at the FISMA Moderate level. We also complete
          a privacy impact assessment and privacy threshold analysis whenever the API gateway sends
          new kinds of data to new systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          We rely on mature software that is used in other security-sensitive environments: Kong
          (nginx), PostgreSQL, and Okta. These are all running in VA&apos;s{' '}

        </p>
        <p>Here are some of the ways our authentication offers additional security:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We use a vetted, commercial-identity proofing solution, ID.me, to verify the identities
            of Veterans and their representatives.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use a vetted, commercial-identity management service{' '}
            <a href="https://www.okta.com/">(Okta)</a> to authorize API access.
          </li>
          <li>
            For APIs that expose Veteran protected health information or personal identifiable
            information (PHI or PII), we issue authorization tokens through our OAuth flow, with
            Okta serving as a broker between ID.me and Master Person Index (MPI).
          </li>
          <li>
            If the API provides access to Veteran PHI/PII <strong>and</strong> interaction with VA
            system users but
            <strong> does not</strong> provide Veteran-facing interaction, the API Gateway will
            provide a mechanism to integrate with VA Single Sign-on internal (SSOi).
          </li>
          <li>For APIs that do not expose PII/PHI, we issue unique API keys.</li>
          <li>
            We are currently in the process of integrating with VA single sign-on to provide

          Unifying API access through the API Gateway benefits our API providers and those who
          consume their APIs, like you. We support multiple authentication types for many common
          integration needs, including:

          <li>Veteran authentication</li>

        <h3 id="oauth">OAuth</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> is short for Open Authorization and is an
          open-source protocol that allows a user to grant third-party access to their personal
          information. Examples are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Veteran granting a mobile application access to their VA health records</li>
          <li>
            A Veteran service officer allowing a case management system to check a Veteran’s
            benefits status
          </li>
          <li>A Veteran authorizing a discount program to confirm their Veteran status</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Through OAuth, we ensure that API interactions are secure and seamless. We generate and
          send an OAuth token that securely retrieves, sends, and updates data.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          Consumers whose application cannot securely hide a client secret will use our{' '}
          <a href="https://oauth.net/2/pkce/">PKCE</a> OAuth flow.
        </p>
        <h3 id="api-key">API Key</h3>
        <p>
          APIs that don&apos;t include PII/PHI are secured using an API key, an authentication
          mechanism relying on the generation of a secret key, which is shared with each unique API
          consumer. This way, each consumer is approved before being granted access.
        </p>
        <p>
          API keys are maintained within Kong. There is no default expiration date. If a key needs
          to be rotated on a recurring basis, VA can either update the key immediately or update it
          on a rolling basis, where both keys work for a short period of time and the user
          facilitates the update on their end with no downtime. The information passed to the API
          provider does not change when the key is updated for the consumer.
        </p>
