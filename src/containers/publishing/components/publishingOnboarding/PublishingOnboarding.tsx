      The process of publishing your API on VA Developer can seem daunting, but don’t worry. Our
      process is designed to ensure your questions are answered and we are both prepared for your
      API’s go-live day and beyond. Here’s what you can expect during the publishing process.
      Remember, we’re here for you each step of the way.

      Giving us some information about you and your API lets us know how we can best work together.
      The Contact Us form will ask you to tell us about your API. It helps to have this information
      ready before you start filling out the form. Here’s some of what we’re looking for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>API summary, such as background, intended consumers, how it works, and goals</li>
      <li>OpenAPI specification and public-facing description, if you have it</li>
      <li>Information on public or internal VA network accessibility</li>

    <h2>Onboard consumers</h2>
    <p>
      Onboarding existing and new consumers is easy when you have our support. As part of preparing
      your API for publication, we’ll have a consumer migration plan ready to go. When you reach
      this phase of your API publishing journey, it’s as simple as identifying your first consumer
      to onboard and following the plan we’ve created together. Consumers must get production access
      by following our <Link to={CONSUMER_PROD_PATH}>path to production guide</Link>.
