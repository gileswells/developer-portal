      VA Developer uses the{' '}
      <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect</a> standard to
      allow Veterans to authorize third-party applications or Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs)
      to access data on their behalf. The kind of access granted, process for authorization, and
      third party being authorized depends on the API.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step toward authorization is to{' '}
      <Link to="../sandbox-access">fill out our application</Link> and make sure to select the right
      OAuth API for your needs. To complete the form, you will need:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your organization name</li>
      <li>To know which OAuth APIs you want to access</li>
      <li>To know whether your app can securely hide a client secret</li>
      <li>Your OAuth redirect URI</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After you submit the form, we&apos;ll send you an email containing access information for test
      data and the sandbox environment, including a client ID and secret if you can safely store a
      client secret. If you cannot safely store a client secret, we will send you a client ID and
      you will use the <Link to="#pkce-authorization">Proof Key for Code Exchange</Link> (PKCE) flow
      (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636">RFC 7636</a>) for authorization.
